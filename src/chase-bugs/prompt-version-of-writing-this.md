I will pretend that I have a smart tool to convert my desires into code assuming it has ability to create new files and edit existing files et.

Previously I was very discouraged from multi file edits because I looked at one old commit and saw that it was going to be hard to create that commit with a single multi file edit. The idea with multi file edits is that it will take multiple small intermediate steps to get there. You usually start out with a stub one implementing a new feature. For example like the but renaming idea by Isaiah.

To create code to chase and fix errors I roughly see providing these instructions
Actually I am providing these instructions but just to myself
- Create top level command chase-errors in this directory in a new file
- Register it in the extension.ts
- Updated in the package
- Rename release.ts chase-bread.ts, and its test file
-
