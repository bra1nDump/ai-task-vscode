How to make a multi file change.

Suggestions:
- Only make changes based on your task
- Only replace logically complete chunks of code. Avoid replacing sub expressions. Examples:
  - A body of small function
  - A block of code surrounded with new lines
  - A for loop and some variables defined right before it
- Avoid replacing large ranges if most of the code remains the same. Instead use multiple smaller targeted changes
- Make sure symbols you are using are available in scope or define them yourself

Examples:

Given two files (omitted for brevity) and a task to make changes based on crust mentions. The following are acceptable changes to generate.
<change>
<path>src/hello-world.ts</path>
<description>Parametrising function with a name of the thing to be greeted</description>
<range-to-replace>
function helloWorld() {
    // crust pass name to be greeted
    console.log('Hello World');
}
</range-to-replace>
<replacement>
function hello(name: string) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
</replacement>
</change>
<change>
<path>src/main.ts</path>
<description>Use hello world from a helper module and use environment variable to get the user name</description>
<range-to-replace>
// crust use hello world from a helper module and use environment variable to get the user name
</range-to-replace>
<replacement>
import { hello } from './helper';
const name = process.env.USER_NAME || 'World';
hello(name);
</replacement>
</change>

Given this file:
<file>
<path>src/quicksort.py</path>
<content>
# @crust Refactor thus using recursion
def partition(array, low, high):
  i = (low-1)
  pivot = array[high]
  for j in range(low, high):
    if array[j] <= pivot:
      i = i+1
      array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i]
  array[i+1], array[high] = array[high], array[i+1]
  return (i+1)

def quicksort(array, low, high):
  if len(array) == 1:
    return array
  if low < high:
    pi = partition(array, low, high)
    quicksort(array, low, pi-1)
    quicksort(array, pi+1, high)

data = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
n = len(data)
quicksort(data, 0, n-1)
print("Sorted array is:", data)
</content>
</file>

Given a task to address @crust comments, the following is a reasonable change to make. Notice the use of </truncated>. Use it only two truncate range to replace when it is large (over 5 lines). Never truncate replacement.
<change>
<path>src/quicksortpy</path>
<description>Replacing the existing quicksort implementation with a more efficient one</description>
<range-to-replace>
def partition(array, low, high):
  i = (low-1)
</truncated>
    quicksort(array, low, pi-1)
    quicksort(array, pi+1, high)
</range-to-replace>
<replacement>
def quicksort(arr):
  if len(arr) <= 1:
    return arr
  pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
  left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
  middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
  right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
  return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)
</replacement>

  This will throw if the editor has been de allocated! 
  This is likely to happen if the user switches tabs while we are applying the changes
  We don't want everything to fail simply because the user switched tabs or closed it.

  The issue was discovered when awaiting all the changes to be applied creating a race condition for the active editor.
  For the time being I will basically do serial applications similar to how we do it in the extension()

  Ideally we should support two ways of applying changes:
  1. Apply changes to the current editor
  2. Apply changes to the document in the background

  We can try to perform the edit on the editor, and if fails we will perform it on the document.
  Ideally we also want to prevent opening the same editor multiple times within the session.
  This most likely will require another abstraction to keep track of things we have already shown to the user.

/*
The problem this is solving:
On we're submitting files to the LLM we're submitting a snapshot.
As the LLM responds with the changes to be applied to the file, the file might have already changed due to user actions or other LLM edits.
The format that the LLM responds with is a line range in the old file.
Once the LLM picks range to change, it streams in the new content to be used as a replacement for the original range. The way the changes are applied is we replace the full range with the new content every time the new content is updated.

The idea is to take a snapshot of a document, while doing so subscribe to the onDidChangeTextDocument event.
Continuously collect all contentChanges that happen to the document.
Provide a method toCurrentDocumentRange(rangeInSnapshot: LineRange) to convert the line range from the original snapshot to the range in the current document.

Consider this example usage of the API:

const documentSnapshot = new DocumentSnapshot(document)
const originalDocumentText = fileSnapshot.getSnapshotText

Original text:
`Line 0
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
`

// The outer loop is responsible for getting the next range to replace
for await (const changeStream = await llm.changeSet()) {
    const rangeInSnapshot = changeStream.rangeInSnapshotToReplace
    for await (const newContent of changeStream.growingReplacement) {
        // We need to get the current range in the document, since it might have shifted due to other edits
        // before this point in time
        const currentTargetRange = fileSnapshot.toCurrentDocumentRange(rangeInSnapshot)

        // Replaced the adjusted original range with the new newContent
        // This replacement will result in the documentSnapshot receiving the update from the onDidChangeTextDocument event

        // and for future calls to toCurrentDocumentRange to return the correct range adjusted for this recent edit, 
        // as well as all the previous edits that happened
        await editor.edit((editBuilder) => {
            editBuilder.replace(currentTargetRange, newContent)
        })
    }
}

Line ranges are encoded in the following way:
LineRange Ls, Le - Represents the range of Range(Ls, 0, Le, lengthOfLine(Le))


Let's say the LLM responds with the following changes (infer partial states yourself)


Change 0
- rangeInSnapshot: LineRange 0, 0
- Final New Content:
`Line 0
Prepended New Line 0`

    Iteration 0
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 0, 0
    - newContent: ""
    - explanation: This replaces the 0th line with empty content overriding "Line 0", which does not change the line range within the document.
    
    Iteration 1
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 0, 0
    - newContent: "Prepended New Line 0" 
    - explanation: Since the previous replace did not have any affect, the range is still empty, and we are adding a new line to the beginning of the document, the range is now LineRange 0, 0. Notice it changed from an empty range to a non-empty range. This is because the line content grew from empty to non-empty

    Iteration 2
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 0, 0
    - newContent: "Prepended New Line 0\nLine 0" 
    - explanation: This restores the original line. Because we have added a
    between the pretended and the original line, the range is now LineRange 0, 1. This will result in ranges that appear after this range to be shifted down by 1 line.

Document content after fully applying the change:
`Prepended Line 0
Line 0
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
`

Change 1
- rangeInSnapshot: LineRange 1, 3
- Final New Content:
`Replaced Line 1
Line 2
Replaced Line 3
Added Line 4`

    Iteration 0
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 2, 4
    - newContent: ""
    - explanation: This effectively removes line 1-3 (from the snapshot), or lines 2-4 (in the current document) and replaces it with empty content. This sets up the stage for the next edits to be applied. The the original range now becomes lines LineRange 2, 2 after the replacement.
        
    Iteration 1
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 2, 2
    - newContent: "Replaced Line 1"
    - explanation: The range after this replacement it does not change, since the new content occupies the same line range, now the line is just not empty.

    Iteration 2
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 2, 2
    - newContent: "Replaced Line 1\nLine 2"
    - explanation: Range after this replacment changes as we have added an additional line to the new content, the range is now LineRange 2, 3.

    Iteration 2.5
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 2, 3
    - explanation: Sometimes we might recieve not full lines, we need to make sure this gets handled.
    - newContent: "Replaced Line 1\nLine 2\nRe"
    - explanation: Range after this replacment changes as we have added an additional line to the new content, the range is now LineRange 2, 4

    Iteration 3
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 2, 4
    - newContent: "Replaced Line 1\nLine 2\nReplaced Line 3"
    - explanation: The line range has not changed since the last line simply got longer.

    Iteration 4
    - currentTargetRange: LineRange 2, 4
    - newContent: "Replaced Line 1\nLine 2\nReplaced Line 3\nAdded Line 4"
    - explanation: After applying the final new content the range becomes LineRange 2, 5. We will not call toCurrentDocumentRange anymore but if we did this is the range et with output.

- Document content after fully applying the change:
`Prepended New Line 0
Line 0
Replaced Line 1
Line 2
Replaced Line 3
Added Line 4
Line 4
Line 5
`

      There are 3 cases we need to handle:
|
      1. The contentChange is strictly before the range we're looking to adjust
        - Most likely this isn't edit by hand in a different part of the file or this is an LLM changing a different part of the file for cases when we're changing multiple ranges.

        - We need to find line displacement (difference from new line count to old line count for a given content change). We might need to record this information at the time of the change, since it might need us to access the document.
        - We need to adjust the range by the line displacement by adding the displacement to the start and end of the currentRangeb

      2. The contentChange is strictly after the range we're looking to adjust
        - This will not effect the range we're looking to adjust, so we can ignore it

      3. The contentChange exactly matches the range we're looking to adjust
        - The most common case. This will constantly happen as the LLM updates the same range with more and more content as it becomes available.
        - Idea to simplify: I'm now thinking applying only deltas instead of the entire content because we would only need to keep track of a single position where to insert the text. Is will also allow us to edit the code that LLM has already printed out and we might want to change by hand already while it's still working on the rest of that same change.

        - This is kind of similar to the first case because we also need to find the line displacement. The only differences we only add thus to the end range, because the range is strictly expanding or staying the same when we are simply adding more characters to the last line in the range.

      4. The contentChange is partially overlapping the range we're looking to adjust.
        - This is a complex case that we should not encounter with basic usage. Simply return and error.

## [system]:
```md
Creating thoughts:
- Collect all of the information relevant to the task the user is trying to accomplish and restate the task
- Restate any specific instructions that the user has already provided on how to accomplish the task 
- Sometimes parts of the task are already accomplished, clearly state so and consider it stale instructions
- Your detailed plan to accomplish the task

Format:
<thoughts>
{{restating the task and any specific instructions the user has provided}}
{{detailed plan on how to accomplish the task}}
</thoughts>

Creating changes:
- Right after the thoughts block output any changes following "How to make a multi file change"
- Provide a detailed plan for each change using <description>...</description>

First output thoughts, then changes

<thoughts>
The task at hand is to address the @crust comments in the code. Firstly, there is a request to write a test that demonstrates an issue within the apply resolve change file in the 'document-snapshot.test.ts'. This test should use the same edits from previous tests but now diff the current content within the range with the replacement and apply insert edits instead of replacements. The test is expected to fail. Secondly, there is a suggestion to refactor the 'applyResolvedChangesWhileShowingTheEditor' function in the 'applyResolvedChange.ts' file by checking if the old content is a prefix of the new content. If that is the case, an insert operation should be performed at the position of the end of the old content and insert the delta between the old and the new.

Plan:
1. In the 'document-snapshot.test.ts' file, I will create a new test that demonstrates the issue as per the task.
2. In the 'applyResolvedChange.ts' file, I will refactor the 'applyResolvedChangesWhileShowingTheEditor' function to handle the case where the old content is a prefix of the new content.
