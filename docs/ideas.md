# Equity Splitting. Unfortunately requires a side project - but could be backdated

Surely somebody already implemented this. This seems like a great use case for block chain. tea.xyz??

- Crazy idea: Get more ownership of the potential company as you make contributions to the project. The cliff is one percent. Use gpt to assess current value of the project.
- The value is calculated by running gpt on a commit and ranking each part of the patch complexity 1-3. Then we multiply by the number of lines in the patch
- The idea is that if the code is good the current owners would want to merge it to help the project overall and would be okay with diluting their shares

# Reverse the problem of range first content later

We could potentially just generate content first in a chat like format, and then run another prompt to find home for that content automatically.

Would probably not pursue but just logging here anyways.
