# Issues with multi-file edits
There are a couple
- I already give the bread comments effectively providing the location where I want the change to happen
- The model seems to be distracted and does not produce as good over code changes even though I tried multiple times, and continue or basic change but suggests the correct change from the first try

I was also doubting the fact that this is an effective way to actually program with the LLMs. 
Actually combining voice control and native refactors and VSCode is really nice, I can move the functions to other or new files very easily. Vscode updates all the imports etc.

Anyways I have started a new document collecting use cases for multi file edits. Also I feel like I've already written this somewhere I just don't know where I wrote down these thoughts. Probably in the file itself actually
