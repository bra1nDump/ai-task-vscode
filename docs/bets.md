# Speed
- Avoid creating UIs by any means nessesary - vscode is rich enough
- Avoid creating communication protocols - no server, keep in typescript
- Focus on a single development ecosystem - typescript
- Use langchain for all things llm to keep getting free features

# Focus
- Do what Continue is not doing

# Produce good side effects
- Publicaly write about accomplishments, for example diff benchmark?
