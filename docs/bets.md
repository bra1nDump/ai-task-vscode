# Development Speed
- Avoid creating UIs by any means nessesary - vscode is rich enough
- Avoid creating communication protocols - no server, keep in typescript
- Focus on a single development ecosystem - vscode, typescript
- Avoid sessions - get what you see by keeping state in plain text
- ~~Use langchain for all things llm to keep getting free features~~

# Focus
- Features
  - Multi-file editing
  - Language server integration for crawling compile errors
- User perceived speed
  - Partial result application
  - Effective encoding
  - Avoiding printing out repeated information by llm
  - Parallelism
- UX
  - Simple way to interact with the system. I suspect Notebooks.
  - Auto-completion when editing bread files - language server

# Produce good side effects
- Publicaly write about accomplishments, for example diff benchmark?
- These problems are being worked on by the best in the idustry right now, and they will beat me or us to it. Lets go out with some lasting artifacts.
