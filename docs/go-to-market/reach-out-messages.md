# After AI Tinkerers Meetup

Hi, I am the multi-file vscode extension guy from the meetup yesterday https://github.com/bra1nDump/ai-task-vscode, would appreciate a star and a vscode download and will pay it back by starring / testing your project if you want, just message me.
If you are curios about how it works - please do give it a shot in vscode let me know if you have any feedback

Hi George, I am the Multi-File edit vscode guy from the meetup. Huge thanks for starring the repository! Let me know how I can pay it back :D

If you are interested in the coding assistant space and like the multi-file editing approach I am suggesting consider helping me by
- Trying it out in vscode https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bra1ndump.ai-task
- Joining (yes I know ...) another AI discord server on https://discord.gg/2HSphAM2
