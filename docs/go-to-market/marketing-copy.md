Copy in YouTube video description https://youtu.be/wD8ZdIJ9p0Y:

Let GPT-4 based on your comments figure out all the changes that need to be performed in your code:
* Automatically finds code pieces to update
* Updates multiple files at a time
* Provides visual feedback on what changes it is making / planning to make in real time

Github Copilot is great, but it is limited to tab auto complete or replacing a single location in code.

Let me know if you are interested to try this extension or want to help with its development. I plan to open source the code within this week. Thanks for watching!
