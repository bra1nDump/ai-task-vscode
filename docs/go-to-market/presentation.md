## Isaiah's feedback

- Keep intro short: Hello my name is Kirill and I have a vscode exntension similar to GitHub Copilot. I was dissatisfied with copilot being unable to edit multiple files and with me having to tell it what part of the code to update. So I built an extension that does that.

- Don't go into github copilot details - people know what it is.

- Prepare contact info qr code

- Don't apologize for the demo - waste of time

- I need to cut to the chase

- Dont mention the preview window - its obvious what its for
