Why?
Faster to generate changes

## Type at cursor - allows me to replace continue for personal use

- For example current model does not support inserts only some sort of replacement
- The simplest version is to keep reusing the multi file edit prompt and simply instruct to replace a single line with the comment /run
- We can also get rid of the planning stage (maybe we should also inject at using /plan directive)
- Maybe also take into account the @bread files + diagnostics
