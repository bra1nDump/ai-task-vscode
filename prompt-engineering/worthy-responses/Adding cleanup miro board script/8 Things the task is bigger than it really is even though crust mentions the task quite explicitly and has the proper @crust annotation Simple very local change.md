Creating changes:
- Only make changes based on your task
- Only replace logically complete chunks of code. Avoid replacing sub expressions. Examples:
  - A body of small function
  - A block of code surrounded with empty lines
  - A for loop and some variables defined right before it
  - A single line if the change is trivial
  - An entire function if majority of its code needs replacement
- Avoid replacing large ranges if most of the code remains the same. Instead use multiple smaller targeted changes
- Make sure symbols you are using are available in scope or define them yourself
- Keep imports in the header of the file
- Respect indentation of the original range you are replacing

Examples:

Given two files (omitted for brevity) and a task to make changes based on bread mentions. The following are acceptable changes to generate.
<change>
<path>src/hello-world.ts</path>
<range-to-replace>
function helloWorld() {
    // bread pass name to be greeted
    console.log('Hello World');
}
</range-to-replace>
<description>
Context: function
Input: name: thing to be greeted of type string
Output: void
1: Print out "Hello " followed by the name
<replacement>
function hello(name: string) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
</replacement>
</change>
<change>
<path>src/main.ts</path>
<range-to-replace>
// bread use hello world from a helper module and use environment variable to get the user name
</range-to-replace>
<description>
Context: top level code
1: Import hello function from helper module
2: Get user name from environment variable USER_NAME
3: Call hello function with user name
</description>
<replacement>
import { hello } from './helper';
const name = process.env.USER_NAME || 'World';
hello(name);
</replacement>
</change>


Given this file:
<file>
<path>counter.ts</path>
<content>
const Counter: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => count > 0 && setCount(count - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>
      <ul>
        {Array.from({ length: count }, 
          (_, i) => 
            <li key={i}>Item {i + 1}</li>)
        }
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
</content>
</file>

Given a task to refactor the code to use a single div instead of a list, the following are acceptable changes to generate.
<change>
<path>counter.ts</path>
<range-to-replace>
      <ul>
        {Array.from({ length: count }, 
          (_, i) => 
            <li key={i}>Item {i + 1}</li>)
        }
      </ul>
</range-to-replace>
<description>
Context: jsx subexpression
1: Show count value in a div
</description>
<replacement>
      <div>{count}</div>
</replacement>
</change>


Given this file:
<file>
<path>duplicate.ts</path>
<content>
function deduplicate(arr: number[]): number[] {
  const result: number[] = [];
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (!result.includes(item)) {
      result.push(item);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
</content>
</file>

And the task to optimize the code, the following is an acceptable change to generate.
<change>
<path>counter.ts</path>
<range-to-replace>
function deduplicate(arr: number[]): number[] {
  <truncated/>
  return result;
}
</range-to-replace>
<description>
Context: function
Input: arr: array of numbers
Output: array of numbers with duplicates removed
1: initialize a set to track unique numbers uniqueSet
2: initialize result array
3: for each item in arr
4:   if uniqueSet does not contain item
5:     add item to uniqueSet
6:     add item to result
7: return result
</description>
<replacement>
function deduplicate(arr: number[]): number[] {
  const uniqueSet = new Set<number>();
  const result: number[] = [];
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (!uniqueSet.has(item)) {
      result.push(item);
      uniqueSet.add(item);
    }
  }
  return result;

https://developers.miro.com/reference/api-reference#rate-limiting

Your app's requests to the REST API are evaluated per method. Currently, there is a limit of 100,000 credits for API calls per minute. Each REST API method is assigned one of the rate limit weight levels.

My Interpretation: There's no total balance per minute, but rather a balance per minute per method. We don't have to worry about stalling the application because we are deleting boards.

Weight	Cost of one API call	Requests per minute
Level 1	50 credits	2000 (query boards)
Level 2	100 credits	1000 (create node, create edge)
Level 3	500 credits	200 (create board, delete board)
Level 4	2000 credits	50

We will then proceed to delete the boards that were created more than 5 days ago and have not been updated since.
Rate limiting: 200 requests per minute.
So the board deletion is the limiting factor.

Currently the account has 100_000 boards, Let's consider all of them are inactive.
We will need 100_000 / 200 = 500 minutes = 8.3 hours to delete all of them.
We also don't want to stall the rendering of diagrams and board creation because the rate limits apply for

To be safe let's query boards in batches of 50 delaying by one minute between batches.
Will then delete the boards that are considered stale. Should put us at 25% of the rate limit.
Let's kick off this job and see how it does on the course of the day.

https://developers.miro.com/reference/get-boards

Request parameters:
  limit
  string
  The maximum number of boards to retrieve.
  Default: 20

  offset
  string
  The (zero-based) offset of the first item in the collection to return.
  Default: 0.

  sort
  string
  Sort order in which you want to view the result set. Options last_created and alphabetically are applicable only when you search for boards by team.

    default - If team_id is present, last_created. Otherwise, last_opened.
    last_modified - sort by the date and time when the board was last modified.
    last_opened - sort by the date and time when the board was last opened.
    last_created - sort by the date and time when the board was created.
    alphabetically - sort by the board name (alphabetically).
    Default: default

Understanding the task:
- Collect all of the information relevant to the task the user is trying to accomplish and restate the task
- Restate any specific instructions that the user has already provided on how to accomplish the task 
- Used technical style of writing - be concise but do not lose any information
- Parts of the task might be accomplished, clearly state so and consider it stale instructions

<task>
Refactor the Miro board cleanup job in the `miro.ts` file to use the `next` link from the API response instead of constructing a new `nextLink` ourselves. This change is necessary because the current approach of incrementing the offset may not always work correctly due to the way the Miro API handles pagination.
