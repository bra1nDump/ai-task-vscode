Let GPT-4 based on your comments figure out all the changes that need to be performed in your code:
* Automatically finds code pieces to update
* Updates multiple files at a time
* Provides visual feedback on what changes it is making / planning to make in real time

Github Copilot is great, but it is limited to tab auto complete or replacing a single location in code.

Let me know if you are interested to try this extension or want to help with its development. I plan to open source the code within this week. Thanks for watching!

Do wish GitHub copilot could edit multiple files at a time? I do. So I built an extension that does just that.
You specify the task you're trying to accomplish within a comment with @task mention and the extension will figure out all the changes that need to be performed in your code.

Please give it a try and DM me feedback https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bra1ndump.ai-task
