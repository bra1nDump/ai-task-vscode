I created AI Task because GitHub Copilot is unable to do multi-file editing.
The extension can also fix your compile errors in bulk for example after a refactoring.

Give the extension a try https://bit.ly/ai-task-marketplace
If you like it give it a star on GitHub https://bit.ly/ai-task-github

Multi-file editing with AI in VSCode
Works great with Copilot

Based on your comments let GPT-4 update your project's code:
* Automatically finds code pieces to update
* Updates multiple files at a time
* Provides visual feedback on what changes it is making / planning to make in real time

Github Copilot is great, but it is limited to tab auto complete or replacing a single location in code. This extension also works great alongside Copilot.

Do you wish GitHub copilot could edit multiple files at a time? I do. So I built an extension that does just that.
You specify the task you're trying to accomplish within a comment with @task mention and the extension will figure out all the changes that need to be performed in your code. It will include opened tabs if you use @tabs mention, it will also try fixing all errors in your open tabs if you add @errors.

Please give it a try and DM me feedback https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bra1ndump.ai-task
