# Equity Splitting. Unfortunately requires a side project - but could be backdated

I am opened to suggestions, the rough idea is:

- Get more ownership of the potential company as you make contributions to the project. The cliff is one percent. Use gpt to assess current value of the project.
- The value is calculated by running gpt on a commit and ranking each part of the patch complexity 1-3. Then we multiply by the number of lines in the patch
- The idea is that if the code is good the current owners would want to merge it to help the project overall and would be okay with diluting their shares
